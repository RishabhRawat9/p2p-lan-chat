# fix ui - > maybe use lanterna

# handle execeptions properly -> when any of the sockets close exceptions gets thrown that shouldn't happen and the whole app shouldn't crash
# drop out peers that get disconnected by checking their vitals every few seconds and removing them from the list;
# handle multiple peers and 
# make the ui look more cool.
